                    Happy Valentine's Day, future Doctor Iya <3, here's a poem for you:
                        <p>
                            For the girl I adore, why does this happen?
                            You linger in my thoughts, a presence unbroken<br>
                            I long to convey the depth of my emotion <br>
                            Yet, words falter, trapped by a timid devotion <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For your smile's glow steals my breath away,
                            Your kind charm brightens the darkest day,<br>
                            In dreams, your smile a radiant beam,<br>
                            A beauty so profound, it feels like a dream.<br>
                        </p>
